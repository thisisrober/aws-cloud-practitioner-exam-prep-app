## 🚀 Production Deployment

### Option 1: Build for Production

```bash
# Generate the optimized version
npm run build

# This creates the 'dist/' folder with all files ready to serve
```

### Option 2: Deploy on Netlify (Recommended - Free)

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --prod
```

### Option 3: Deploy on Vercel (Free)

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

### Option 4: Deploy via FTP to Your Server

1. Run: `npm run build`
2. Upload the contents of the `dist/` folder to your server via FTP
3. If using a subfolder, update `base` in `vite.config.js`:
   ```javascript
   export default {
     base: '/your-folder/',
   }
   ```
4. Rebuild and upload again

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "npm: command not found"
**Solution**: Node.js is not installed. Download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)

### "npm install takes too long"
**Solution**: This is normal on first installation (2-5 minutes). If it's longer, try:
```bash
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```

### Port 5173 is already in use
**Solution**: Use another port:
```bash
npm run dev -- --port 3000
```

### Changes don't reflect after editing code
**Solution**: The development server has automatic hot reload. If it doesn't work:
1. Save the file (Ctrl+S)
2. Wait 1-2 seconds
3. Reload the browser (F5)

### Error "Module not found"
**Solution**: Make sure you've run:
```bash
npm install
```

### The application looks broken/poorly designed
**Solution**: 
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Del)
2. Reload the page (Ctrl+F5)
3. If it persists, report on GitHub
